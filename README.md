# Express and MongoDB E-Commerce Example

## Course Material
[Fullstack Web Mastery Build Apps with MongoDB](https://mammothclub.com/course/fullstack-web-masterclass-node-and-mongodb-nosql-databases)

### Fair Warning
This course is outdated and I've had to do a decent amount of research to bring my tech up-to-date. That also means that some of the lines may not be in the most updated syntax. 😒 But I'm working through it as an exercise of troubleshooting and working with a legacy codebase. 💁‍♀️

## Required Tech
(Outside of your standard IDE, CLI, etc.)
- [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/)
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)

## Install Order
1. ```npm init```
2. ```npm install```
3. ```npm i mongodb```
4. ```npm install dotenv```
    a. Only necessary if using environment variables (like me).

## Final Verdict
TBD
