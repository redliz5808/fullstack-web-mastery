# Express and MongoDB E-Commerce Example

## Course Material
[Fullstack Web Mastery Build Apps with MongoDB](https://mammothclub.com/course/fullstack-web-masterclass-node-and-mongodb-nosql-databases)

### Fair Warning
This course is outdated and I've had to do a decent amount of research to bring my tech up-to-date. That also means that some of the lines may not be in the most updated syntax. üòí But I'm working through it as an exercise of troubleshooting and working with a legacy codebase. üíÅ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

### Update to the Warning
I've now completely deviated from the course because it was so incredibly outdated. I've left the code from the course commented at the bottom, but I'm working straight from [MongoDB's docs](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/drivers/node/) now.

## Required Tech
(Outside of your standard IDE, CLI, etc.)
- [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/)
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)

## Install Order
1. `javascript npm init`
2. `npm install`
3. `npm i mongodb`
4. `npm install dotenv`
    a. Only necessary if using environment variables (like me).

## Final Verdict
TBD
